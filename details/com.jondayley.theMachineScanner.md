# About

Nice little screenshotting and OCRing utility for use with [theMachine](https://github.com/cadnza/theMachine). Currently configured to work with the Brave browser when theMachine is running.

**Note:** *This workflow currently only copies Russian terms to the clipboard from OCR. The end goal is to have it trigger theMachine on scanning a term, but I don't have a lot of time and I need a minimum viable product.*
