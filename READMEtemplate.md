My settings and workflows for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) since [syncing can be finicky](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/advanced/sync/#second-mac) and [iCloud and Google Drive aren't recommended](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/advanced/sync/#services). Plus [workflows are awesome](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) and get even better with version control.

Here are my workflows so far:
